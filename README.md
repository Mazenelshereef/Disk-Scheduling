# Disk-Scheduling-Algorithms
You should try to compare the output after applying all the following disk scheduling
algorithms (FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK and C-LOOK) as well as the newly optimized algorithm
by implementing their algorithms and applying it on a disk queue with requests for I/O
blocks on cylinders.
Example of cylinders I/O requests:
98, 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, 67
Initial head start cylinder: 53

The newly optimized algorithm procedure and flowchart are found in page 10 in the following paper:

https://research.ijcaonline.org/volume93/number18/pxc3896046.pdf

The following information should be followed:


1- The Input queue like above should be an input to your program from the command
line, from a file or through GUI.


2- The Initial head start cylinder should also be an input to your program and entered by
the user.


3- The output result should show the sequence of head movement to access the
requested cylinders based on the implemented algorithms.


4- Also, show the total head movement per algorithm.
